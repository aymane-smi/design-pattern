#  Singleton design pattern

## use case:

### every country have one governement and this governement have multiple ministries so we don't need a governement foreach one, this the same case where we want to use a class we're it well be called in our app and created once.

### `example`: let's suppose that we created a class called `DB` where we initialize our connection to the DB, in this case we don't need to create a new instance of DB to be used where every is the case in our app each time, so singleton design pattern came to solve this.
